## Optional one-line solution challenge

```python
def make_repeater(func, n):
    return accumulate(compose1, identity, n, lambda _: func)
```

This answer was really beyond my ability. I initially thought of binding the `accumulate` function into the `compose1` function, and only use some terms as `add`, `mul`, etc. So it was no wonder that I was getting in trouble with the returning value as a function. I could only get a numeric returning value with requirement of last number. 

This solution made me marveling, where use `compose1` as combiner and use `lambda` function with an underscore as a place-holder. The second parameter `identity` was what I once though of, because I noticed that there are these lines at the beginning of `accumulate`:

``` python
    if n == 0:
        return base
```

which consist with the requirement. But I abandoned the idea since I never though the input could be a function. 

## Just for fun Question

### Church Numerals and Lambda Expressions

Functional Programming

### Remaining Queations

However, there still are many questions remaining unsolved. 

1. How to understand the `successor` function? 

``` python
def successor(n):
    return lambda f: lambda x: f(n(f)(x))
```

2. Is there any relationship between Church Numerals and recursion?
